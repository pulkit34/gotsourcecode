      Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation
      of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is A Game of Thrones.
      It is filmed in Belfast and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, Spain, and the
      United States. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and its seventh season ended on
      August 27, 2017. The series will conclude with its eighth season premiering in 2019.Set on the fictional continents
      of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plot lines and a large ensemble cast but centers on three primary
      story arcs. The first story arc centers on the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and
      conflicts among the dynastic noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the
      throne. The second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting
      a return to the throne. The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm
      against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures that lie far north, and an impending winter
      that threatens the realm. Game of Thrones has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, international
      fan base. It has been acclaimed by critics, particularly for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production
      values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) has been criticized. The series
      has received 38 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015 and 2016, more than any other primetime
      scripted television series. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation
      (2012–2014), a 2011 Peabody Award, and four nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama
      (2012 and 2015–2017). Of the ensemble cast, Peter Dinklage has won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting
      Actor in a Drama Series (2011 and 2015) and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or
      Television Film (2012) for his performance as Tyrion Lannister. Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Maisie Williams,
      Diana Rigg, and Max von Sydow have also received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for their performances in the series.
